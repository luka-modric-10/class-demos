        <h1>Tropical Cyclones</h1> 

        <p>A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain and/or squalls.
        </p>

        <p>Depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names, including:
        </p> 
        
        <ul> 
            <li> tropical storm </li> <li>,cyclonic storm,  tropical depression or cyclone.
        </ul>
